<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
<p>
  The Collab Lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for
  everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.
</p>
<p>
  This code of conduct applies to all Collab Lab spaces, including but not
  limited to our GitHub and Slack teams, both online and off. Anyone who
  violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces
  at the discretion of the RESPONSE TEAM.
</p>
<p>
  Some Collab Lab spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made
  clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing
  and abiding by these rules.
</p>
<p>Harassment includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
    orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical
    appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices,
    including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
  </li>
  <li>Deliberate misgendering or use of “dead” or rejected names.</li>
  <li>
    Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour  in spaces where they’re
    not appropriate.
  </li>
  <li>
    Physical contact and simulated physical contact (e.g., textual descriptions
    such as “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop.
  </li>
  <li>Threats of violence.</li>
  <li>
    Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a
    person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
  </li>
  <li>Deliberate intimidation.</li>
  <li>Stalking or following.</li>
  <li>
    Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for
    harassment purposes.
  </li>
  <li>Sustained disruption of discussion.</li>
  <li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
  <li>
    Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming
    inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.
  </li>
  <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.</li>
  <li>
    Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their
    consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional
    abuse.
  </li>
  <li>Publication of non-harassing private communication.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The Collab Lab prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged
  people’s comfort. RESPONSE TEAM reserves the right not to act on complaints
  regarding the following: “Reverse”-isms, including “reverse racism,” “reverse
  sexism,” and “cisphobia”.
</p>
<h2>Reporting</h2>
<p>
  If you are being harassed by a member of The Collab Lab, notice that someone
  else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the
  RESPONSE TEAM immediately. If the person who is harassing you is on the team,
  they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as
  promptly as we can.
</p>
<p>
  This code of conduct applies to Collab Lab spaces, but if you are being
  harassed by a member of The Collab Lab outside our spaces, we still want to
  know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by Collab Lab
  members, especially Founder Andrew Hedges, seriously. This includes harassment
  outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The
  abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from The Collab Lab based on
  their past behavior, including behavior outside Collab Lab spaces and behavior
  towards people who are not in The Collab Lab.
</p>
<p>
  In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to
  reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended
  to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.
</p>
<p>
  We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims
  of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve
  received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if
  we believe that doing so will increase the safety of Collab Lab members or the
  general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative
  consent.
</p>
<p>You can report violations in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Email Stacie Taylor-Cima, Lisa Smith, Michelle Sauque, and Adrienne Lowe at
    <a href="mailto:code-of-conduct@the-collab-lab.codes"
      >code-of-conduct@the-collab-lab.codes</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    Direct message @stacie, @lisa, @michelle, and/or @adrienne in the Collab Lab
    Slack workspace
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>
  Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
  immediately.
</p>
<p>
  If a participant engages in harassing behavior, RESPONSE TEAM may take any
  action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all Collab
  Lab spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other Collab
  Lab members or the general public.

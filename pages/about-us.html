  The Collab Lab increases access to web development jobs for early-career
  developers and, in particular, people in under-represented groups in tech by
  providing experiential skills training in software team collaboration and
  career management.

<h2 id="origin-story">Our Origin Story</h2>
<p>
  In June of 2019,Andrew Hedges grabbed a
  quick beer before
  <a
    href="https://www.meetup.com/Portland-JR-DEVELOPER-Meetup/events/256869529/"
    >that month’s PDX Junior Developer Meetup</a
  >
  with <a href="https://www.pdxcodeguild.com">PDX Code Guild</a> graduate Scott
  Stine. The two were talking about the difficulties involved in making the leap
  from coding bootcamp to first job as a professional web developer when Andrew
  came up with the idea for The Collab Lab.
</p>
<p>
  At the Meetup, Andrew recruited Caitlyn Greffly—who at the time was attempting
  to make the transition into her first developer job—to participate and it was
  clear the idea had merit.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Collab Lab kicked off our first cohort that August</strong> with
  Scott, Caitlyn, Stacie Taylor, and Kate Sowles participating as developers
  with Andrew mentoring the group through the 8-week project.
</p>
<p>
  Since we launched, the response to Collab Lab has been overwhelmingly
  positive, further confirming the need for what we’re doing. As of April,
  2022, we’ve worked with 164 early-career developers in 6 countries and are
  working hard to scale up the program to accommodate demand.

    >Collab Lab gave me a framework for how to navigate relationships on a
    software development team. I feel more confident and prepared walking into
    my first dev job with the communication experience I gained through all of
    the code reviews, retrospectives, and pair programming sessions. So thankful
    for the program and the supportive mentors who make it happen!</q

      "I am very grateful to be part of the Collab Lab community. I got my first
      job right around the time that I joined the 10th cohort, and while I
      picked up a lot of technical skills from working at my company, I learned
      a lot about the review workflow and working in an agile environment from
      TCL. The best part about TCL is that the support doesn't stop after the
      program's eight weeks- I love being part of TCL's slack channel because it
      is a safe, non-judgmental place to ask questions and learn, and you have
      the opportunity to connect with other devs outside of your workplace. The
      mentors are wonderful coders and people, and it's a great feeling to have
      so many fellow software engineers cheering you on. Thank you, TCL! :D"

      "I firmly believe TCL has played a huge role in the success I have found
      in tech so far. During the first cohort, I landed my first job as a
      developer and was able to speak to processes and collaboration during my
      interviews that I wouldn't have been able to otherwise. During my time in
      the advanced cohort, I landed my second developer job. This was a huge
      level up for me, both in terms of title and financially, and I don't think
      I would have been able to land a React gig without my time in the advanced
      cohort (I was working in an Angular shop at the time). Beyond that, I have
      always felt so supported and uplifted by this community! I highly
      recommend it to any aspiring developer. "

      "Remember your favorite high-school teacher? The one that was cool, funny,
      amazing at their job, helped you get ready for the real world and most
      important of all, had boat loads of empathy? TCL ===
      clone(yourFavoriteHighschoolTeacher, 100) Andrew, Stacie, the TCL mentors
      including all the developers helped create an enriching environment where
      I picked the soft skills necessary to be an effective collaborator. In
      addition, TCL really emphasizes the importance of what it means to be a
      responsible developer and I think that's really awesome. "

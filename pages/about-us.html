  The Collab Lab exists to help early-career developers gain their footholds in
  tech by providing real-world experience working on software teams.

<h2 id="origin-story">Our Origin Story</h2>
<p>
  In June of 2019, <a href="/who-we-are/#founder">Andrew Hedges</a> grabbed a quick beer
  before
  <a
    href="https://www.meetup.com/Portland-JR-DEVELOPER-Meetup/events/256869529/"
    >that month’s PDX Junior Developer Meetup</a
  >
  with <a href="https://www.pdxcodeguild.com">PDX Code Guild</a> graduate Scott
  Stine. The two were talking about the difficulties involved in making the leap
  from coding bootcamp to first job as a professional web developer when Andrew
  came up with the idea for The Collab Lab.
</p>
<p>
  At the Meetup, Andrew recruited Caitlyn Greffly—who at the time was attempting
  to make the transition into her first developer job—to participate and it was
  clear the idea had merit.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Collab Lab kicked off our first cohort that August</strong> with
  Scott, Caitlyn, Stacie Taylor, and Kate Sowles participating as
  developers with Andrew mentoring the group through the 8-week project.
</p>
<p>
  Since we launched, the response to Collab Lab has been overwhelmingly
  positive, further confirming the need for what we’re doing. As of November, 2020, we’ve worked with 60 early-career developers in 6 countries and are working hard to scale up the program to accommodate
  demand.

    >Collab Lab gave me a framework for how to navigate relationships on a
    software development team. I feel more confident and prepared walking into
    my first dev job with the communication experience I gained through all of
    the code reviews, retrospectives, and pair programming sessions. So thankful
    for the program and the supportive mentors who make it happen!</q

  The Collab Lab is
  <strong>volunteer-driven and free for participants.</strong> We intentionally
  and actively work to overcome barriers to opportunities for women and other
  under-represented minorities in tech.
</p>
<p>
  We make use of free/<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/freemium"

  tools (i.e. Airtable, Firebase, GitHub, Google Docs, Netlify, Slack, Notion, and Zoom)
  as much as possible. We would love to have the ability to use upgraded
  versions of some of these tools to provide a better experience for our
  volunteers and participants. To this end, we accept

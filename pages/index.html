  <h3>The Collab Lab is…</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Collaborative</strong> group project practice</li>
    <li>
      A place to work alongside your <strong>peers</strong> in a fully remote
      setting
    </li>
    <li>
      An opportunity to <strong>learn</strong> from experienced developers
    </li>
    <li>Volunteer run and <strong>free</strong> for developers</li>
  </ul>

      >Collab Lab gave me agile team experience I didn’t get through my coding
      bootcamp. I honestly don’t think I would have landed that first job offer
      without being able to talk about my experience with pair programming and
      resolving merge conflicts. Beyond that, I made some great friends!</q

  <p>
    <a href="/about-us/#developers">Successful Collab Lab developers</a>
    come in having already learned basic web development and programming
    concepts. We don’t teach coding; we teach collaboration! You don’t need a
    ton of experience, but
    <strong
      >you should have completed the equivalent of a coding bootcamp</strong
    >
    where you’ve learned (at a minimum) basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and have
    completed a project or two in
    <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>.
